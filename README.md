I am a passionate and curious developer who loves to explore new technologies and create innovative solutions. 
Having over 20 years of experience in the industry, means I have seen the rise and fall of many frameworks, languages, and paradigms.

I've witnessed the dawn of the web, the emergence of mobile, the evolution of cloud, and the revolution of AI.
